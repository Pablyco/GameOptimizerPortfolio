## ðŸŽ® About Me  
  
I'm a dedicated Unreal Engine Optimization Specialist with hands-on experience as a solo indie developer. My journey in game development has been driven by a passion for creating immersive, high-performance gaming experiences, whether it's achieving smooth frame rates, reducing draw calls, or ensuring efficient asset management. I bring a problem-solving mindset to every project, focused on delivering games that are as optimized as they are engaging.  
  
As an indie developer, I've taken games from concept to completion, handling everything from code and design to fine-tuning the performance. My expertise includes using tools like Unreal Insights, Stat Unit, LODs, and optimization viewmodes to analyze and improve CPU/GPU performance, memory usage, and lighting complexity. My experience with these tools has equipped me to tackle technical challenges head-on, ensuring each game runs smoothly across a range of platforms.  
  
Iâ€™m excited to take my specialization to the next level in a remote role, collaborating with teams that share my commitment to high-quality gameplay. I'm especially interested in roles where I can contribute to performance optimization, bringing out the best in games by making them efficient and accessible to all players.
