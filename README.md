### Chester The Chest

- **Description**: Step into the role of Chester, an animated treasure chest, as he navigates puzzles, hidden items, and beautifully designed levels. Chester's world combines the charm of PS1 and Nintendo-style graphics with pixel art aesthetics.
- **Key Features**: Unique blend of retro graphics and puzzle-solving gameplay
- **My Role**: As the sole developer, I handled all aspects of this project, including programming, art, music, and design.

### Portfolio Project: One-Week Challenge

A self-imposed challenge to push my technical boundaries and expand my skill set.
## Project Goals:
1. Implement AI Systems (New Territory)
    - Developed an AI patrol system that navigates through 4 patrol points, cycling back to the starting point
    - Implemented detection logic to have the AI notice and pursue the player
    - Created a "melee range" check, allowing the AI to attack the player when in range
2. 2D and 2.5D Character Development
    - Created a hybrid character system combining 2D sprite animations with 2.5D world positioning
    - Carefully blended the 2D and 3D elements to achieve a unique visual style
3. Quake-Style Movement Recreation
    - Implemented classic Quake movement mechanics, including:
        - Air control
        - Strafing
        - Bunny hopping
    - Optimized the movement system for smooth, responsive gameplay
